Pente AI Game Application
1. Introduction
Welcome to the Pente AI Game Application! This software allows you to play the classic strategy board game Pente, either against a friend (PVP) or against a challenging computer opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning and heruristics Function.

Pente is played on a 19x19 grid. The goal is to be the first player to achieve five stones in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or to capture five pairs of your opponent's stones (ten total).

2. Setup and Main Menu 
When you first launch the application (python main.py), you will be presented with the main menu.
2.1 Main Menu Options
Option Play PVP , Play AI , Change Theme , Quit
Function Starts a standard Player vs. Player game , Enters the AI difficulty selection submenu , Cycles through the available graphical themes (Wood, Sunset, Ocean Mist, etc.) , Closes the application
Notes | Player 1 (Black) moves first , You choose your color (Black or White) , This changes the appearance of the board and pieces

2.2 Selecting AI Difficulty
When you choose "Play AI," you must select a difficulty level. This level directly corresponds to the search depth of the Alpha-Beta algorithm
Difficulty |Search Depth |AI Behavior
Easy       |Depth 1 or 2 |Fast, but prone to simple tactical errors."
Medium     |Depth 3,     |Balanced search depth, challenging for casual players."
Hard       |Depth 4,     |Deep, aggressive search requiring precise play."

3. Gameplay Controls and Interface
3.1 Making a Move
 
 Control   |Action                                                         |Effect

4. AI Performance Monitoring (Advanced Feature)
When playing in "Player vs. AI" mode, the application displays a special metrics panel to track the AI's real-time performance. This feature is primarily for developers and students analyzing the algorithm's efficiency
Metric | Display        |Description
Time   |Time: 454.37 ms | The total execution time (in milliseconds) the AI took to calculate the move.
Nodes  |"Nodes: 6,415"  |The total number of game states (nodes) the Alpha-Beta algorithm had to explore before finding the best move. This proves the efficiency of the pruning technique.
Depth  |Depth: 4        |The current search horizon selected for the AI opponent.

5. Troubleshooting and Tips
Game Freeze:
 If the AI is set to a high depth (4+) and the board is complex (mid-game), the game may pause for several seconds while the AI calculates the move. Do not close the window; the calculation will finish.

Returning to Menu:
 Press the ESC key at any time during gameplay to return to the main menu.
